I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires.

When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet.

I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don't have a aux cable so I'm not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won't work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won't connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it's a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it's been 4 months and it's super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that's all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice.

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 …,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don’t support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4.

If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon.

A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues.

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days.

Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4.

It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon.

Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company.

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily.

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 …,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don’t support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1.

Switch on the TV, and it already knew me, and my Amazon Prime Account.  After a brief online security check, all my content and apps automatically appeared on-screen, and setup was done!OPTICAL AUDIO OUTI'm using a JBL soundbar with sub-woofer which are connected to my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV using an optical cable (not supplied), and by simply changing settings on the TV my audio system automatically switches on and off with the TV, and the supplied TV Remote has volume controls for my cinema sound.  The sound reproduction is First Class.

English (Indian), or Hindi.My Amazon Firestick, Echo Show 8, Echo Show 5, Echo, and Echo Dot all have settings for English UK, Aus, USA, etc, Spanish, French, German, and many other languages.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range.

My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch.

My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch.

My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products.

Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can't replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980's. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned ""patch issue. Software update dint happen"" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.,Its really good smartphone in its range packed with features. And brand like Samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point. I still give it a 3.7 stars as battery 🔋 could be better. It also looses a point for not including a charger.,Phone looks are good. The charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger 25W original. Also camera quality is not even like 32 MP, total lied about 108 MP. Samsung UI is not very friendly and easy. Other brands have better and smoother UI.,Phone is very sleek, bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is....... Good budget model phone,you can not deny brand ,sumsung is a brand .overall good product for long use.,Good worck,Charger should have been part of it. But product looks good,Pricewise a little overpriced.Some of the cons are: a little rigid fingerprint sensor, after 2 months of use, i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone, battery life not up to the mark, struggles to go the entire day even with regular use, no 3.5 mm jack, and a buggy BT.Pros: a very good camera, excellent screen, superb sound quality.If you somehow get this for below 18k, then go for it or else there are better options available.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418vxJS4AML._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-sAmoled-Purchased-Separately/dp/B09XJ5LD6L/ref=sr_1_333?qid=1672895842&s=electronics&sr=1-333,Smartphones,MR,High,B09XJ5LD6L High MR Smartphones,80.28,What are the different purposes for using this night light?,"The night light on this device can be used for multiple purposes such as providing ambient lighting, serving as a reading light, or even as a gentle alarm clock.

Prompt service by Amazon. Package was sealed. Did not find any tampering. Watch body is plastic built. At this price point, could have been metal one. Detailed review will be shared in few days,Now after the battery gets fully charged it drains from 100 to 0 % in just 10 minutes .i don't know what happened to it .,Watch design is good. In picture shows dark grey color watch but i recived silver grey. Screen wakeup time is slow otherwise everything is good.,Using this watch for couple of days now. Overall I liked it.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range.

Bought this yesterday, so haven’t used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.,The quality of power button is very low easily it can break,Nice Product, works as expected as of now no issues,Good,Very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.There's a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons (right/left clicks)It will not bother most of you, I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things, So...[Personally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, (click click click)]Battery life of Logitech is known to be very good.,Quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price.,good product on which you can use for long time,This is good mouse, thanks to Amazon for providing this product at reasonable price.

I wanted a wired earphone and when I searched on Amazon I found Boult in such a low price and I ordered it. Recieved it today.Checked it by connecting to my phone and I was surprised by the audio quality. This is a nice product in this price range and the mic is also good. The build quality is average and you can't complain considering the price. It also has a clip to attach the earphone to your shirt like the good old Nokia days. It has total 3 pair or ear tips (2 in a zipper packet and 1 already attached to the earphone).  The manufacturing date is March 2022. So, it's quite new actually, not an old stock. It also has that anti-slip ear hook, which is an added advantage. In general, it is a good product for this price.,I was looking for reliable Bluetooth earbuds on a budget, and settled on these. Personally, I am pleased with them. I have been using them for almost four months now, including one month when they saw around 12 hours of use per day.PROS:▪ Comfortable.▪ Elegant and sober appearance.▪ Reasonable battery life. I would let the earbuds recharge at, for example, mealtimes.▪ Decent range. Going a few meters into the next room, with a concrete wall in between, was no issue.▪ The battery status of the dock is shown by a series of LED blinks. Simple and practical.CONS:▪ Mediocre phone calling quality. In particular, the microphone. The few conversations I had using these went successfully, so this was not a deal breaker, but the clarity was not the best for sure.The touch controls were initially a drawback for me, but I got used to them. Also, this product does not come with a charger. Either charge off of your computer, or buy a charger with the recommended electrical output. As for the sound quality, it is acceptable, not superlative. I have listened to music, and I have watched films and YouTube videos, with no problem.As a final note, I prefer this type of earbud over the in-ear type, because I find it more hygienic. Wiping with a clean cloth after each use, and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time, should help to slow fungal growth.,Very Good Product, nicely fits in the ear and comfortable .The Volume seems to be a little low at the highest.But, A good Buy,Sound quality is good everything is balanced but bass dominance is too high and couldn't hear the treble and other notes,very good bass quality And Worth for money earphones I ever Buy.. also Product Quality is awesome 🔥❤️,it doesn't fit as snugly in my ears, maybe it is cause of greasy ears, but the product is good, highly recommended,,Bolte audio bass is very good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DbAD6EoCL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Boult-Audio-X1-Earphones-Cancellation/dp/B07TCN5VR9/ref=sr_1_28?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-28,In-Ear,MR,Low,B07TCN5VR9 Low MR In-Ear,56.53,What are the different ways in which this multi-purpose night light can be used?,"This multi-purpose night light can be used in a variety of ways, such as answering or rejecting calls, playing and pausing music, and using voice commands.

Now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half, whereas left one keeps going, so reducing one star. Will contact them for replacement and update here.Update 2: Called service center, they asked to bring it, but am lazy. I expected they'd replace at home. Paid more attention towards the issue above. The stable situation is that just after full charge, right bud can go upto 4 hrs, but left one always goes for 30-60mins more, and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two (when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems), so I guess I can still use the buds but with certain restrictions :) Will happily restore 5 stars if the issue stays stable for next 3 months.--------------Update after 6 months--------------No change in quality, still the pack charges the buds like a boss. During this period, they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour (very dangerous, thankfully he couldn't swallow them!), full of saliva and whatnot, and on another occasion I threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force (undisclosed depressing reason) due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached, which I then re-attached. After all this, buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day 1. I think these are pretty darn sweet deals! Lack of volume control, etc. etc. is all forgiven. Happy customer. Although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists.-------------------Original review-------------------Using for last 2 months.I am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist. But I hadn't used any tws yet, so wanted to dip my toes and didn't want to invest much, but also not something throwaway. So settled for boult (no boat etc. due to their highly adultered sound signature), since I have previous experience with it. I like my music flat at studio quality. More recently, I've been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance: oneodio pro50. Go ahead and search it. It is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fans.Coming to this tws.Connectivity. Right out of the box, only left one was working after connecting to my iphone. Maybe right one didn't pair correctly to left. Did that reset thing as suggested (which also took some effort), but after that, both started working and since then, no issues. I am using both my phone and laptop (linux). Ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another. But perfect connectivity now. I can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss, which is great.Call quality is decent, faced no disconnects yet, and the other party is also ok with my voice, but you cannot talk in a hushed voice, you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand you.Features. Tapping is oddly sensitive, I mean it responds even if I am adjusting the bud, and not touching the central area, but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to play/pause. I can get used to that though. One thing, track aage peeche is ok. But these don't have anything which can control the volume. Bummed on that.Battery. Decent backup. It's been nearly 2 months. I use buds on an average of 2-3 hours daily, and I just had to charge the main case just 3-4 times. In an emergency I also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly. I was happy to see that. One weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left, infact I can use the left one 20-30 mins more that the right. But anyways, I put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery.Sound quality.Bass frequencies: Very decent bass. Surprisingly great low bass (songs like 'the humma song', 'i wanna love you' sound pretty good), but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass ('lut gaye' by Jubin doesn't sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature). Overall for the most part, you should be fine.Other frequencies: I'll review this from vantage point of studio quality signature. For mids, the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass (but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above), but its bearable. For highs, initially I felt the presence [a bit] lacking, which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks, but after using it for a few days, I started feeling alright in that aspect, maybe some burn in? God knows. Also remembering that I paid just 1800 bucks for these! I mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so I think my mind won't be nitpicking then. I'll soon be upgrading though.Overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k. Cheers!,Hey.  .This one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice that's the only disadvantage on this one..,Right buds not performs well, I am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,Been using these for a month now. Can't massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough (may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass) and provides good noise isolation. Very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and I use it every day. If you can snag it on a deal for ~1500 bucks it's a fantastic deal.,My only issue is,  we can't change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click.

The housings are ergonomically shaped housings and angled at 45 degrees. They do not fall out of the ears easily, even during intense activities. The silicone tips are nothing to write home about, but that is expected considering the price.There is a three-button inline remote with mic located right below the right earpiece, which can be used to answer calls, control music playback, and trigger the voice assistant on your smartphone. The buttons themselves are quite mushy and difficult to distinguish between by touch alone.Xiaomi Mi Earphones performanceXiaomi claim that the Mi Earphones feature a '3rd generation balanced damping system' that creates a transparent sound, and 'metal sound chambers' created via a 20-step process. Marketing fluff aside, how do the earphones really sound? Simply put: surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for two.While most earphones in this price range have over-inflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range, the bass response on the Mi Earphones is controlled and restrained. It doesn't overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs. That said, bassheads will be left slightly wanting.It's surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix, although they do get overpowering sometimes. The mids are slightly repressed, which is evident in vocal-heavy genres such as blues. While the clarity on offer is decent for the price, songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy. This is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bass.,This earphone set is fantastic. And highly deserving of money. I used it for a while last in 2022, and now I'm buying it once more in 2023. In my perspective, the Mi headset has good music and is easy to use.,good good,Nice product.Gentle bassNo loud soundProduct quality is decentDon't expect heavy music experience,It's sometime uncomfortable but it's fine i can adjust,Seriously if you are a bass lover, then you can go for it.But it's built quality is not good, it will damage automatically after 3-4 months,it is not suitable for rough uses.,Got it for less than 300rs. Not disappointted at all.If you compare it with other brands like Boat, the sound quality isn't as good as the contemporaries. But for the price I paid, I'm not disappointed at all.The bass is solid.

As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let’s have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term “Ultra” came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5”inches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won’t give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn’t have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MB/s to 15 MB/s if that’s a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesn’t work.@ SPEED (  The de-merit detail )  : I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MB/sec and went down & down to 10-11 MB/sec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MB/Sec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline “Ultra” and mentioned speeds of 130 MB/sec (which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement & not reversal.I know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MB/s -Read & 19 MB/s – write which looked like a mere consolation. Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile & S2 tablet too was not fast.Verdict : Yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as “Ultra-slow”.@ STORAGE : Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough.@ WARRANTY : The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers.@ PRICE : I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, Dual drive & brand image. MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks & it was tagged made in Malaysia. Only if, it was a bit faster.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, Ultra-tagline & modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write rates.Even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. It could have been a great all-rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk & 5 years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,COVERED HERE: Actual storage space, Heating, Mobile Phones, Tight Fitting on mobile phones, Speed, Formatting File System, Value for Money, Free App, Company, Brand, Seller.About Company, Product & Seller:1. SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external hard-disk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable.2. About 3 to 5 years ago, WD Elements & Portable drives of 2TB and 4TB were priced Rs. 1200 less than current day prices. They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon.3. Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon.4. For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. Reason for higher prices for same brand's same capacity storage devices may be various - such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.REVIEW: SanDisk Ultra Dual 64GB USB 3.0 OTG Pen Drive (Gold):1. STORAGE SPACE: Just as in external hard-disk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. SAME AS OTHERS: For the 64GB pen drive, actual storage space available is 57.2GB. This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. This is because it has FAT32 File System. Also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use.- In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT32 pen drive is shown to be 61.5GB. So that's 4GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System.3. HEATING: Even with just 10 minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. This heating does not happen in WD external hard-disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. MOBILE PHONES: The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well.5. TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES: The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones & tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. VALUE FOR MONEY: Even if you don't use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 3.0 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers.7. SPEED: The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop, Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones.8. FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE: Unless you are sure you won't use your pen drive on a particular device, don't format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File System.But For Example, If you have decided that you won't use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don't want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- With your Linux system's file format, you will have better storage space than any Windows File System.- BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it won't work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which don't have Windows Operating System. Same way, if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System, it won't be recognised on Windows laptops, Android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is.9. FREE APP: Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive. It is easy to install and doesn't take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access. It is very useful App with easy user-interface. App takes 64MB storage space on Android Phones.- Features include: cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phone's File Manager App. Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive. Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive and Add MicroSD card storage to manage all your files from just one Memory Zone App. Restore Backup. Copy, Move, Delete, files as well as clean up WhatsApp related files. See available storage space on your phone. See data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10. BEWARE - Users of Memory Zone App should know that they agree to Terms of Use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy - such as illegal copy, storage, distribution of Movies, Music, Software, Books, etc as per DMCA copyright laws then the Company will provide the user's data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners.OVERALL - best product in the market, at best price in Indian market, with features not offered by other companies for similar specs.,Value for money.

The information provided below is as per the manufacturer. Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. It Features 10 mm drivers. Rated Impedance of 16 ohms. Comes with 1.2 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable. 3.5 mm Gold-Plated L-Shaped Audio Jack (90 degrees). Sensitivity : 98 dB+/-3 dB.____________________Built Quality & Design---------------------------------I was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal. It has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel & attractive appearance. The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable & does it's job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. Despite the metal construction, Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight & comes with a microphone & L-Shaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. Overall the built quality is excellent for the price & seems very durable. The ear buds have proper L & R labels and are clearly visible. Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.___________Audio Quality-------------------To ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit, I used high-quality MP3 files of 320 kbps & Lossless audio formats like FLAC & WAV. For smartphone listening, I used Poweramp music player & tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. For the computer, I used iTunes player & VLC Audio player. I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod, iPhone & Sony MP3 Player. All this went for more than 10 days & finally, I had my results.Boat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. During my tests with them, I found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. The treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear & pleasant to ears. The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent. When listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.______________________Noise Isolation & Comfort-------------------------------------When it comes to Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it, They come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, I wasn't able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely & delivered an immersive experience. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff & somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. Since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now & then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didn't happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now & then while running (maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it), An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it. When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as I got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.-----------------------------------------Flat Cable & Microphone-----------------------------------------The cable is great, I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free & comes with a rubberized coating. The cable does its job well. The microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. During calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up/reject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. It can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225.____________________Warranty & Price---------------------------------Boat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty._____________Final Thoughts!----------------------I've personally used Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and I'm pretty much impressed with them. I'm personally a fan of Extra Bass IEM's and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDR-XB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDR-XB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didn't disappoint me, obviously it doesn't stand a chance in front of Sony MDR-XB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225 & the quality they offer, I was really very impressed.Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, I can say that they're amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, I'll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like Poweramp (Android) for better bass output. The treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average.*****************************My Rating : 4 out of 5*****************************____________________The Verdict---------------------------------Taking everything into account, overall I'm very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage. Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids & highs. Overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. I'll recommend these IEM's to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop sound really great on them. Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.HOPE I HELPED YOU.THANKS,Yes, so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500. Yes you can consider it to buy. But there are few points to remember before buy. From my user experience I can tell you this-1. This is not comfortable at all. It slips from ear mostly. You feel pain in ear after using it.2. Never buy this for ONLINE CLASS, as it is not possible to wear it 6-8 hours straightly.3. After switching from Boat Basshead 172, I feel that the bass is not good as the previous one. I don't know why. It should be better.4. Sound don't explode or go outside of the buds to 50% as it go outside on Boat 510 headphone, so its good.5. Feeling heavier on ears. Not as comfortable as Realme Buds 2. Though both are metal build. For balance sound you can buy Realme Buds 2.6. Buy it only to listen music, not for too long time. Do not consider it for Online class and Long time wear session.  Hope it helped you. Its just my opinion from using Boat 225, Boat 172, Boat 510, Realme buds 2, Mi basic.,It's a very good product but i don't recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head, they will fall off easily with the slightest motion, you will soon find it annoying. Sound quality, build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you.,Raat me apne Babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta h,I purchased the product a year ago.It worked fine.I love the sound quality.but you may not expect it to work after a year.My headphone doesn't work  now properly .My warranty get expired so ,I have to buy a new one.,Good buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 6-7 month,Sound quality is above average .. but I got 1.5 years old manufactured ear phones.. build quality is as per cost . can't expect much .. there is buzzzzz sound when music is silent..,The earphones sound is awesome",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/3101FmUqUOL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/boAt-BassHeads-225-Special-Headphones/dp/B01MF8MB65/ref=sr_1_191?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-191,In-Ear,HR,Medium,B01MF8MB65 Medium HR In-Ear,51.21,What makes this night light suitable for multiple purposes and different rooms in the house?,"The night light's PVC cable is not only durable, but also tangle-free, making it suitable for multiple purposes and different rooms in the house.

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 …,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don’t support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1.

Double clicking within a month and scroll wheel scrolling in the reverse direction randomly.Edit 1The warranty requires you to take the mouse to their service centre which was a pain as it took me a while to find the nearest service centre and the address was incorrect. The service centre was helpful though as they replaced my mouse in a matter of minutes with no hassle. Will edit based on how the replacement works.Edit 2Replacement mouse working well so far.,This mouse feels and looks awesome, the slight rubbery texture feels premium and the build quality is also amazing, but the clicks seems to be a little sensitive. For regular use it’s amazing. Can’t get better but for gaming, i would want a mouse with a little sturdier click, i click heavy during gaming and the mouse may take it but it remains in my head. So even for light gaming it’s fine where use of click is less as compared to fps shooting games.,It is an awesome upgrade for beginner level gamers, just changing mouse can actually improve your experience and gameplay. My boyfriend recommended this to me as we play Valorant together and my aim was persistently bad even though i tried so hard playing with regular Bluetooth dell mouse, changing from that to this piece was a great doing, 100% recommended if you're just starting to play anything like CSGO/Valorant or any other first person shooter game on regular basis.,i purchased it on16dec and i am writing this on 19dec and i'll be honest no other mouse can offer this much quality in this price so if you can buy it just go ahead but but there's an alternative mouse by razer almost the same price razer deat ader i guess that's the name so you better check that one if rgb is not your priority yiu can choose that one bye....,Go for it,Design is easy to hold and there are extra buttons on right side which I find very useful.

Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup: It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1-star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app (Mi Home). It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day(!) of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn't have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you'd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it'd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. What's more! You get ads in the app right after opening it (on the dashboard where you see the list of devices) since version 5.4.43 (released on Dec 26, 2018). I wish Xiaomi released a dedicated app for home security cameras, like other companies have done.Google Assistance isn't compatible with this camera, if you are into that sort of thing. Some other cameras from Xiaomi (not released in India) are supported, though.Once paired to the app and once you have the perfect setup (with NAS and good wireless bandwidth to / from the camera), you may become addicted to use it under different conditions, such as with total darkness.If you are technically sound and have around 10k budget, Raspberry Pi based home security is a better option! If you are on a budget and if you don't want to spend a lot of time on technical things, then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera is the best home monitoring camera you can get!,Good enough!

I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and I'm aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one (GTS2/GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc) with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa (yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update). I'd have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display (has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro). It still isn't released in India.Coming to the watch's performance, the typical features I tried today (first day) are Heart RATE (HR), SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch aren't very accurate to my surprise (heart rate variation by 5-10 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10% points at times) . But I still feel it's more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It won't surprise me if I don't get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldn't control the phone camera as I couldn't get that feature to work (refer to image and help me if you can). I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.To conclude, I wouldn't say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy (at least the Honor bands I've seen). Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as I'm curious what all it can do.I would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Let's see.Update (8th Jan 2021): The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. I'm hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device (4) and the app (57). Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didn't dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didn't have an issue, but could not clear individual items (clear all worked),REVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS 2 Mini Smart watch (2021 model)Hello everyone . Since the new model of amazfit GTS2 mini arrived , i am going to review the old model of itPros:Display : 1.55 inch amoled display , really good look . ( pros)Battery : coming with 220 maH , from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer ( normal use ) . But If you are a light user ,it can last it for 14 days . (Pro)IP rating :IP 68 water resistant which is cool .(Pro)Heartbeat sensor : It has heartbeat sensor and it is real , but it may not show real accuracy at all the time . But it performs good (pro)Comfortness : It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material. (pro)Work out modes : There are nearly 70+ workout modes and i tested out some , since it is built in GPS , it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well. (pro)can track stressHas PAI feature to progress your workout with better experienceAlexa assistant ( but need phone connection to activate this )Has other modes like breathing ,menstrual cycle tracking,to-do-list , inbuilt alarm ,pomodoro timer ,sleep tracker ,Timer , In built compass , camera remote ,find the phone , controlling music etc.Notification system : you can get notifications .Call control system : You can accept or reject calls , but you cannot able to talk through watch.Cons:Build quality :it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium . and half is poly carbonate (con) .Watch faces : the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good . (con)SPO2 : I don't know how much accurate it is , but coming to technical part , the sensors are failing most of the times . Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history .(con)Verdict :It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality .,The incoming call notification disconnects if you're away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch. I have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors, even though it's not Damaged. Water resistance is good. I used to wash dishes wearing it. No use of Alexa.i think it's a good buy after 2 months of usage,all over Amazfit GTS2 Mini (New Version) is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback. apart for this other things are really nice.,Sleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watch.Rather all thing are fantastic and battery life is 7 day in normal uses",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41eEK+FeFyL._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Amazfit-Version-Always-Display-Monitoring/dp/B09TBCVJS3/ref=sr_1_403?qid=1672903014&s=computers&sr=1-403,SmartWatches,HR,High,B09TBCVJS3 High HR SmartWatches,53.15,What are the different purposes that this night light serves?,"This night light can serve multiple purposes, such as providing a crystal clear image with its high resolution display, being lightweight and comfortable to wear during both day and night activities, monitoring blood oxygen levels, tracking various sports modes, and even controlling music without needing to use your phone.

There are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter. It is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need. In this review I will answer your questions about the PIGEON AMAZE PLUS 1.5L ELECTRIC KETTLE.1. Can I trust the reviews for this ad? Are they genuine?Probably yes. But know that the seller lists several types of PIGEON Kettles in the same ad. Unless the review refers to this particular model - you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one. The ratings are also an aggregated mix. There could be 10 negative review of the product you are seeing and 10 positives for the other products. The page will show you a neutral review. That's the game sellers are playing these days - to avoid negative reviews. I have posted a picture of the stove I am referring to in this review.2. WATTAGE: Important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up. This one is 1500W - meaning that you can switch it on ... brush your teeth and find the water is boiled. Great time saving !! My earlier one was 900W and it used to take 10-15 minutes of patient waiting. The gas stove boiled water faster. This one takes about 3-4 mins to heat 2 mugs of coffee3. CABLE LENGTH: Most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length. I have purchased kettles to find they have only a 2-foot long cable ... and I had to return them. This one has cable length of 22"" (slightly more than one meter) - which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug.4.  CONNECTOR:  This one uses a 6A plug - which is most common in India. Be careful because from >1500W onwards, most kettles use a 16A plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle. Strictly speaking, it should have a 16A plug, but then this is kept on for short intervals only.5.  CAPACITY:  1.7 litres as mentioned - though I could not see markings for max and min levels. This is good enough to make 4-5 decent sized mugs of coffee6.  COOKING OTHER STUFF:  The ad says only water - but I see no reason why you cannot heat Maggi etc. Maybe you can. But avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects.7. LOOKS: Quite okay for the price. It will not make your kitchen look bad - and neither will it enhance the looks. This is the most common look that an electric kettle can have.8. PERFORMANCE: I have used for 2 days only. No complaints so far. There is a 1-year guarantee card accompanying the product9. HANDLE: Very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle. Does not feel very heavy even if there is a full 1.7L of water.10. NEGATIVES: This is a steel jug. The outside will automatically heat up. If you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle, you need to be a little careful.VERDICT - ""BUY""(at the time of writing this review, this costs less than Rs 700. I have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews - therefore I am also mentioning the price range based on which I gave this product a 5 star review),The body is very lightweight and doesn't feel sturdy. Does the job of heating water fast and that's it. Cord length could be a little longer. The plastic parts doesn't feels sturdy. The top cap has a smaller dia so a man's hand has a trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands. Overall it's okay.,Its quality was not too much good, light quality product but according to price its okay.Easy to use product & good for save time.,Good product for boiling water. shock proof.

I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product. I have been using it daily, sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period. I hope this will help others.Mixer includes +capacity -1 Mixer body1 Plastic blender jar 1500ml + fruit filter,1 Wet grinding jar 1500 ml1 Dry grinding jar 1000 ml1 Chutney grinding jar 400 ml1 extra Pounding Blade1 SpatulaBuild and overall appearance1. The mixer-grinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerful.I have used it to grind both dry & wet ingredients such asgaram masala, idli/dosa mix, Chana dal paste, Poppy seeds paste,coconut chutney, dry rice and urad dal powder, ginger garlic paste, ice, etc.I regularly blend and make milk shakes, lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient.2. Does the job fast within few seconds/minutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with.3. Body is good looking, sturdy, well balanced and easy to wipe clean.4. The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience.5. Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake.6. The jars also are easy to use and quite well-builtJars & Blades1. The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades.2. Chutney jar blade is fixed.3. An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect.4. A spatula cum blade changer is provided.5. The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic.6. Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquids/materials while grinding/blending.7. Each lid has rubber gaskets. This gives a completely leak proof experience while grinding/blending. These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach.8. All Jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars.9. In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided – this is the only thing I have not used, hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment.10. Blender can be used without the juicer sieve, and works fine.11. In wet blender a flow-breaker is providedSoundSound is high, but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machine.Do’s & Don’tI feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product1. Do not overload2. Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest.3. When turning the speed knobs – don’t turn all at once from 0 to max. You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly, staying at each speed for a few seconds. Actually for most things  low to medium speed is enough. The machine is really powerful.4. When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up ( not the machine) so give a little rest in between.5. For wet grinding – use cold water to grind – that way the jar will never heat up.6. DO NOT grind hot ingredients. Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting – that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground. Bring food to room temp and then grind.7. Wash the jar, gasket, jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact.8. Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets.9. In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it.10. To remove fine particles when dry grinding don’t use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar. You can use your hand and a brush ( used for this purpose only).11. This is an expensive piece of equipment – In my house only I & my husband use it. We do not allow  children or household help/cooks to use it. This way the machine will not be misused.12. If you mixer does not work  – please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine. Remove some of the ingredients and try again.13. Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops – Although they appear quite well made, I cannot say if they will break when dropped.Pros1. The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises2. It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience3. Easy to clean4. Grinds and blends everything5. Leak-proof lids.6. Takes very little time to grind7. The motor does not heat up even easily8. The overload protector works perfectlyCons1. Guarantee & Manual - The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon websiteThe Amazon payment is the guarantee. There is no separate guarantee card provided. I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card.2. Delivery - The mixer-grinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding. This was a big minus for me.3. A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided – one of my lid clasps was loose, it is working fine at the moment, but as a backup company should provide these.4. As the jars are pretty large, for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult. I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry & wet grinding rather than only wet.5. The jars do have screws heads on the inner side – but this is not a big deal – and can be cleaned quite easily.,Review after using for few monthsPros: The lock feature is really good for hands free usage. Grinds very fast. Say, half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than 4 minutes. Juicer is good, extraction is good for the juicy fruits. Good design and takes less space in kitchen.Cons: Noise is there for the power it grinds. But anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which I read before my purchase.Steel jars get heated up quickly. So I used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heat.Just need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a little.(wet grinding jar)Tips- clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge. So that jars won't loose it's shine 🙂,I bought this Bosch mixer on 2020 and the motor is not working I have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in it.it worked only for 2 years.it was only for household purpose i purchased.very much disappointed with a brand.Showed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside .,True to its name the Bosch Mixer Grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen. However the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challenge.,NA,This is a very good product overall. The dosa/idli and other such batters come out excellent. The motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needs.The only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer. It works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus, oranges, watermelon, etc. But the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content, the juicer fails at extracting anything. The juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp. There is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush them.All in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juices.,I was a happy customer of Sujata for the past 10 years and Bosch was a a good optionGood design, powerfull motor , worth for the price i bought (5500 in offer ),It has a powerful motor, does grinding pretty fast. Compact size. Lid lock clip very useful. Priced high.

This frother takes out all the lumps and bumps. Because the resulting blend is smooth, it does not waste the ingredients like stirring with a spoon. So, so great! It has made my favorites even more practical and delicious. I have not found anything about this product that I do not like. I would recommend this product to others and have already done so. Get it!

Especially, the extension pipes could be Stainless Steel same as the Drum and Telescopic in feature / operation. The main Vacuuming head attachment used for floor / hard surfaces could also be Stainless Steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit, would extend its life.Its a 2 pin plug, instead of a 3 pin which could have been better with a surge protector fuse.The cord is of decent length, quite impressed with the quality of the cord. Also, the cord, which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit, after use can be rested on top of the Drum in a winding fashion, it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance. Hose, same solution.The 2 side Latches are reasonably strong. Wheels are easy to install / insert and work fine.It would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored / latched to the main unit while not in use, storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regard.First demo was for the Vacuum.Noise average (not too loud or unbearable), reasonable with any other domestic Vacuum of similar power.Inside the lid, the dust bag clings on to its inlet, would be better if it could be secured / locked with a clip.In Vacuum (suction) mode the air gets forced out of the Blower outlet, this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level. Now imagine, if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces, it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail. If this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable Ac vents like in cars, then it could direct the blown out air upwards while Vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design sense.Suction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts, nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important.Then, follows the demo for the Blower.This feature should technically be equally as strong as the Vacuum, because the force of the air sucked in while Vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the Blower outlet. To make things interesting, there are fish gill like 2 vents on either sides of the Lid. These vents are the fixed kind, cannot be closed or opened. One of the vent very faintly can be felt taking-in air, while the other vent blows out air at a significant force. This particular phenomena I am bewildered with, cause as I understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the Blower outlet. So make of it what you will. Still does the job, if you're looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours pet.Finally, the demo for the Wet.Performance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations, again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important. May need to dry mop even after using the Wet function.In closingDefinitely do purchase it, use it often as required and also helps keeping fit,Do not allow dust to settle on your Vacuum Blower.Also ordered extra:i) American Micronic Replacement Dust Bag for AMI-VCD21-1600WDx & AMI-VCD15-1600WDxii) RODAK 35 MM Mattress and Upholstery Nozzle for Vacuum Cleaner Wet and Dry Cleaning, EU Import,It have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner, even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners. I bought this for my mother in-law. She likes it for being easy to use. It's simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes, Extension pipes are little loose though. It's easy to clean those cat hairs now. And don't have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor, because it's Wet and dry vaccum cleaner. Hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise. They send me already opened package, but not used I think. They could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package. No complaints untill now. I liked the reusable dust cover feature, also it's easy to connect it inside. Easy to handle, don't have too much weight.It would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switch.,This is a domestic beast.... great suction.Only thing that should had been ther is speed control.Noise level is high, but with such suction is ok. As long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again, I am ok...Rest how it will stay with time will be something to see.,It is very easy to clean as the suction power is great 👍 very powerful machine indeed,I have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now. I recently came across this and read the reviews etc. Some were good and some were bad. But at the same time I couldn't find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners  in this price segment so I finally bought it.It came in a big Amazon box well packed and secured. Unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images. Here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible :⁠-⁠)• Very Good quality steel and plastic build💯• The suction(28kpa) is really really good even with the thick carpets etc💯• The wheels are really good too,They move effortlessly 💯• You get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and they're good quality 💯• The blower function is really powerful 💯• The bag inside,which collects the dust & dirt is big and can be cleaned & Washed easily 💯• The noise level isn't much. Its okay, Not loud💯• The cord length is 5mtrs which is enough 💯• The overheating protection is Good💯• All the Accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the base💯Cons:• The only thing that I think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes. They are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats you're cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again.🌟 Overall a 10/10 Product which fits all your needs,Wet and Dry [Cleaning of course;⁠) ].Better than any other Vaccum cleaners in under 10k price range . Go for it 💯( P.s I've tried some other Vaccum cleaners too which are in the 6k and above range but this is the all in one OP Vaccum Cleaner💯),Good suction with great built quality,Good durability,good suction power and quality product,Vacuum cleaner is very fine, suction power is quite good, drying power is also just OK,noise level is high as I expected. Cost is high as compared to other brands. Overall I rated it four star.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41tcKYuBPSL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/American-Micronic-AMI-VCD21-1600WDx-Wet-1600Watts-21-litres-Stainless/dp/B072NCN9M4/ref=sr_1_317?qid=1672923607&s=kitchen&sr=1-317,Wet-DryVacuums,HR,High,B072NCN9M4 High HR Wet-DryVacuums,27.11,What type of light source is used in this multi-purpose night light and how does it benefit the user?,"The multi-purpose night light uses an LED light source, which is energy-efficient and long-lasting.

I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product. I have been using it daily, sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period. I hope this will help others.Mixer includes +capacity -1 Mixer body1 Plastic blender jar 1500ml + fruit filter,1 Wet grinding jar 1500 ml1 Dry grinding jar 1000 ml1 Chutney grinding jar 400 ml1 extra Pounding Blade1 SpatulaBuild and overall appearance1. The mixer-grinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerful.I have used it to grind both dry & wet ingredients such asgaram masala, idli/dosa mix, Chana dal paste, Poppy seeds paste,coconut chutney, dry rice and urad dal powder, ginger garlic paste, ice, etc.I regularly blend and make milk shakes, lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient.2. Does the job fast within few seconds/minutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with.3. Body is good looking, sturdy, well balanced and easy to wipe clean.4. The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience.5. Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake.6. The jars also are easy to use and quite well-builtJars & Blades1. The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades.2. Chutney jar blade is fixed.3. An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect.4. A spatula cum blade changer is provided.5. The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic.6. Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquids/materials while grinding/blending.7. Each lid has rubber gaskets. This gives a completely leak proof experience while grinding/blending. These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach.8. All Jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars.9. In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided – this is the only thing I have not used, hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment.10. Blender can be used without the juicer sieve, and works fine.11. In wet blender a flow-breaker is providedSoundSound is high, but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machine.Do’s & Don’tI feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product1. Do not overload2. Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest.3. When turning the speed knobs – don’t turn all at once from 0 to max. You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly, staying at each speed for a few seconds. Actually for most things  low to medium speed is enough. The machine is really powerful.4. When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up ( not the machine) so give a little rest in between.5. For wet grinding – use cold water to grind – that way the jar will never heat up.6. DO NOT grind hot ingredients. Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting – that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground. Bring food to room temp and then grind.7. Wash the jar, gasket, jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact.8. Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets.9. In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it.10. To remove fine particles when dry grinding don’t use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar. You can use your hand and a brush ( used for this purpose only).11. This is an expensive piece of equipment – In my house only I & my husband use it. We do not allow  children or household help/cooks to use it. This way the machine will not be misused.12. If you mixer does not work  – please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine. Remove some of the ingredients and try again.13. Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops – Although they appear quite well made, I cannot say if they will break when dropped.Pros1. The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises2. It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience3. Easy to clean4. Grinds and blends everything5. Leak-proof lids.6. Takes very little time to grind7. The motor does not heat up even easily8. The overload protector works perfectlyCons1. Guarantee & Manual - The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon websiteThe Amazon payment is the guarantee. There is no separate guarantee card provided. I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card.2. Delivery - The mixer-grinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding. This was a big minus for me.3. A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided – one of my lid clasps was loose, it is working fine at the moment, but as a backup company should provide these.4. As the jars are pretty large, for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult. I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry & wet grinding rather than only wet.5. The jars do have screws heads on the inner side – but this is not a big deal – and can be cleaned quite easily.,Review after using for few monthsPros: The lock feature is really good for hands free usage. Grinds very fast. Say, half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than 4 minutes. Juicer is good, extraction is good for the juicy fruits. Good design and takes less space in kitchen.Cons: Noise is there for the power it grinds. But anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which I read before my purchase.Steel jars get heated up quickly. So I used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heat.Just need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a little.(wet grinding jar)Tips- clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge. So that jars won't loose it's shine 🙂,I bought this Bosch mixer on 2020 and the motor is not working I have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in it.it worked only for 2 years.it was only for household purpose i purchased.very much disappointed with a brand.Showed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside .,True to its name the Bosch Mixer Grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen. However the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challenge.,NA,This is a very good product overall. The dosa/idli and other such batters come out excellent. The motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needs.The only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer. It works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus, oranges, watermelon, etc. But the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content, the juicer fails at extracting anything. The juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp. There is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush them.All in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juices.,I was a happy customer of Sujata for the past 10 years and Bosch was a a good optionGood design, powerfull motor , worth for the price i bought (5500 in offer ),It has a powerful motor, does grinding pretty fast. Compact size. Lid lock clip very useful. Priced high.

Bought this yesterday, so haven’t used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.,The quality of power button is very low easily it can break,Nice Product, works as expected as of now no issues,Good,Very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.There's a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons (right/left clicks)It will not bother most of you, I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things, So...[Personally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, (click click click)]Battery life of Logitech is known to be very good.,Quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price.,good product on which you can use for long time,This is good mouse, thanks to Amazon for providing this product at reasonable price.

There are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter. It is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need. In this review I will answer your questions about the PIGEON AMAZE PLUS 1.5L ELECTRIC KETTLE.1. Can I trust the reviews for this ad? Are they genuine?Probably yes. But know that the seller lists several types of PIGEON Kettles in the same ad. Unless the review refers to this particular model - you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one. The ratings are also an aggregated mix. There could be 10 negative review of the product you are seeing and 10 positives for the other products. The page will show you a neutral review. That's the game sellers are playing these days - to avoid negative reviews. I have posted a picture of the stove I am referring to in this review.2. WATTAGE: Important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up. This one is 1500W - meaning that you can switch it on ... brush your teeth and find the water is boiled. Great time saving !! My earlier one was 900W and it used to take 10-15 minutes of patient waiting. The gas stove boiled water faster. This one takes about 3-4 mins to heat 2 mugs of coffee3. CABLE LENGTH: Most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length. I have purchased kettles to find they have only a 2-foot long cable ... and I had to return them. This one has cable length of 22"" (slightly more than one meter) - which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug.4.  CONNECTOR:  This one uses a 6A plug - which is most common in India. Be careful because from >1500W onwards, most kettles use a 16A plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle. Strictly speaking, it should have a 16A plug, but then this is kept on for short intervals only.5.  CAPACITY:  1.7 litres as mentioned - though I could not see markings for max and min levels. This is good enough to make 4-5 decent sized mugs of coffee6.  COOKING OTHER STUFF:  The ad says only water - but I see no reason why you cannot heat Maggi etc. Maybe you can. But avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects.7. LOOKS: Quite okay for the price. It will not make your kitchen look bad - and neither will it enhance the looks. This is the most common look that an electric kettle can have.8. PERFORMANCE: I have used for 2 days only. No complaints so far. There is a 1-year guarantee card accompanying the product9. HANDLE: Very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle. Does not feel very heavy even if there is a full 1.7L of water.10. NEGATIVES: This is a steel jug. The outside will automatically heat up. If you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle, you need to be a little careful.VERDICT - ""BUY""(at the time of writing this review, this costs less than Rs 700. I have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews - therefore I am also mentioning the price range based on which I gave this product a 5 star review),The body is very lightweight and doesn't feel sturdy. Does the job of heating water fast and that's it. Cord length could be a little longer. The plastic parts doesn't feels sturdy. The top cap has a smaller dia so a man's hand has a trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands. Overall it's okay.,Its quality was not too much good, light quality product but according to price its okay.Easy to use product & good for save time.,Good product for boiling water. shock proof.

The kettle heats efficiently and does exactly what it was designed to do, and does it very well.  Well worth the extra cost.  Highly recommend.,Excellent 👍,This is better than expected !!easy to use ,really fast nd above all its safe ....the length of the cord is okay (if you have dedicated spot the vessel) or else a half foot more will be better and comfortable.I can recommend this to all,Wire length is very small,Product quality is excellent. Using the same model for the past 4 yrs without any issues. We use it for boiling water. We boil the water for drinking and for making tea. We use the kettle atleast 5 or 6 times a day an twice in a day we boil water with its full capacity. So we boil water 1 or 2 cups to full capacity everyday.Recently, the lid got detached, so purchased a new one with the same capacity and model. To my surprise, the kettle comes with bigger plug for which we don't have suitable socket. Hence returned the product and received refund promptly.There is no mention of the plug size in the product description. I give 5 star to the product and wish to buy again, only if it is provided with 5/6A plug. Hope Philips takes note of this!Advice: Please use it only for boiling water and there will be no trouble, works for years! The kettle opening is not so wide compared to some other makes, but that will not be an issue if it used only for boiling water as intended.,,Chord length is less.

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 …,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain.

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 …,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain.

But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain.

As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let’s have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term “Ultra” came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5”inches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won’t give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn’t have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size.

I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration.

As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let’s have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term “Ultra” came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5”inches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won’t give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn’t have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MB/s to 15 MB/s if that’s a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesn’t work.@ SPEED (  The de-merit detail )  : I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MB/sec and went down & down to 10-11 MB/sec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MB/Sec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline “Ultra” and mentioned speeds of 130 MB/sec (which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement & not reversal.I know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MB/s -Read & 19 MB/s – write which looked like a mere consolation.

As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let’s have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term “Ultra” came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5”inches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won’t give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn’t have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MB/s to 15 MB/s if that’s a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesn’t work.@ SPEED (  The de-merit detail )  : I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MB/sec and went down & down to 10-11 MB/sec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MB/Sec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline “Ultra” and mentioned speeds of 130 MB/sec (which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement & not reversal.I know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MB/s -Read & 19 MB/s – write which looked like a mere consolation. Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile & S2 tablet too was not fast.Verdict : Yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as “Ultra-slow”.@ STORAGE : Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough.@ WARRANTY : The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers.@ PRICE : I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, Dual drive & brand image. MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks & it was tagged made in Malaysia. Only if, it was a bit faster.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, Ultra-tagline & modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write rates.Even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price.

MOBILE PHONES: The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well.5. TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES: The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones & tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. VALUE FOR MONEY: Even if you don't use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 3.0 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers.7. SPEED: The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop, Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones.8. FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE: Unless you are sure you won't use your pen drive on a particular device, don't format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File System.But For Example, If you have decided that you won't use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don't want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- With your Linux system's file format, you will have better storage space than any Windows File System.- BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it won't work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which don't have Windows Operating System. Same way, if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System, it won't be recognised on Windows laptops, Android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is.9.

As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let’s have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term “Ultra” came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5”inches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won’t give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn’t have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MB/s to 15 MB/s if that’s a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesn’t work.@ SPEED (  The de-merit detail )  : I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MB/sec and went down & down to 10-11 MB/sec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MB/Sec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline “Ultra” and mentioned speeds of 130 MB/sec (which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement & not reversal.I know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MB/s -Read & 19 MB/s – write which looked like a mere consolation. Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile & S2 tablet too was not fast.Verdict : Yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as “Ultra-slow”.@ STORAGE : Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough.@ WARRANTY : The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers.@ PRICE : I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, Dual drive & brand image. MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks & it was tagged made in Malaysia. Only if, it was a bit faster.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, Ultra-tagline & modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write rates.Even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. It could have been a great all-rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk & 5 years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,COVERED HERE: Actual storage space, Heating, Mobile Phones, Tight Fitting on mobile phones, Speed, Formatting File System, Value for Money, Free App, Company, Brand, Seller.About Company, Product & Seller:1. SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external hard-disk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable.2. About 3 to 5 years ago, WD Elements & Portable drives of 2TB and 4TB were priced Rs. 1200 less than current day prices. They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon.3. Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon.4. For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. Reason for higher prices for same brand's same capacity storage devices may be various - such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.REVIEW: SanDisk Ultra Dual 64GB USB 3.0 OTG Pen Drive (Gold):1. STORAGE SPACE: Just as in external hard-disk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. SAME AS OTHERS: For the 64GB pen drive, actual storage space available is 57.2GB. This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. This is because it has FAT32 File System. Also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use.- In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT32 pen drive is shown to be 61.5GB. So that's 4GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System.3. HEATING: Even with just 10 minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. This heating does not happen in WD external hard-disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. MOBILE PHONES: The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well.5. TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES: The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones & tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. VALUE FOR MONEY: Even if you don't use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 3.0 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers.7. SPEED: The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop, Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones.8. FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE: Unless you are sure you won't use your pen drive on a particular device, don't format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File System.But For Example, If you have decided that you won't use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don't want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- With your Linux system's file format, you will have better storage space than any Windows File System.- BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it won't work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which don't have Windows Operating System. Same way, if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System, it won't be recognised on Windows laptops, Android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is.9. FREE APP: Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive. It is easy to install and doesn't take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access. It is very useful App with easy user-interface. App takes 64MB storage space on Android Phones.- Features include: cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phone's File Manager App. Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive. Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive and Add MicroSD card storage to manage all your files from just one Memory Zone App. Restore Backup. Copy, Move, Delete, files as well as clean up WhatsApp related files. See available storage space on your phone. See data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10. BEWARE - Users of Memory Zone App should know that they agree to Terms of Use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy - such as illegal copy, storage, distribution of Movies, Music, Software, Books, etc as per DMCA copyright laws then the Company will provide the user's data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners.OVERALL - best product in the market, at best price in Indian market, with features not offered by other companies for similar specs.,Value for money.

To make things interesting, there are fish gill like 2 vents on either sides of the Lid. These vents are the fixed kind, cannot be closed or opened. One of the vent very faintly can be felt taking-in air, while the other vent blows out air at a significant force. This particular phenomena I am bewildered with, cause as I understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the Blower outlet. So make of it what you will. Still does the job, if you're looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours pet.Finally, the demo for the Wet.Performance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations, again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important. May need to dry mop even after using the Wet function.In closingDefinitely do purchase it, use it often as required and also helps keeping fit,Do not allow dust to settle on your Vacuum Blower.Also ordered extra:i) American Micronic Replacement Dust Bag for AMI-VCD21-1600WDx & AMI-VCD15-1600WDxii) RODAK 35 MM Mattress and Upholstery Nozzle for Vacuum Cleaner Wet and Dry Cleaning, EU Import,It have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner, even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners. I bought this for my mother in-law. She likes it for being easy to use. It's simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes, Extension pipes are little loose though. It's easy to clean those cat hairs now. And don't have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor, because it's Wet and dry vaccum cleaner. Hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise. They send me already opened package, but not used I think. They could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package. No complaints untill now. I liked the reusable dust cover feature, also it's easy to connect it inside. Easy to handle, don't have too much weight.It would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switch.,This is a domestic beast.... great suction.Only thing that should had been ther is speed control.Noise level is high, but with such suction is ok. As long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again, I am ok...Rest how it will stay with time will be something to see.,It is very easy to clean as the suction power is great 👍 very powerful machine indeed,I have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now. I recently came across this and read the reviews etc. Some were good and some were bad. But at the same time I couldn't find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners  in this price segment so I finally bought it.It came in a big Amazon box well packed and secured. Unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images. Here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible :⁠-⁠)• Very Good quality steel and plastic build💯• The suction(28kpa) is really really good even with the thick carpets etc💯• The wheels are really good too,They move effortlessly 💯• You get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and they're good quality 💯• The blower function is really powerful 💯• The bag inside,which collects the dust & dirt is big and can be cleaned & Washed easily 💯• The noise level isn't much. Its okay, Not loud💯• The cord length is 5mtrs which is enough 💯• The overheating protection is Good💯• All the Accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the base💯Cons:• The only thing that I think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes. They are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats you're cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again.🌟 Overall a 10/10 Product which fits all your needs,Wet and Dry [Cleaning of course;⁠) ].Better than any other Vaccum cleaners in under 10k price range . Go for it 💯( P.s I've tried some other Vaccum cleaners too which are in the 6k and above range but this is the all in one OP Vaccum Cleaner💯),Good suction with great built quality,Good durability,good suction power and quality product,Vacuum cleaner is very fine, suction power is quite good, drying power is also just OK,noise level is high as I expected. Cost is high as compared to other brands. Overall I rated it four star.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41tcKYuBPSL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/American-Micronic-AMI-VCD21-1600WDx-Wet-1600Watts-21-litres-Stainless/dp/B072NCN9M4/ref=sr_1_317?qid=1672923607&s=kitchen&sr=1-317,Wet-DryVacuums,HR,High,B072NCN9M4 High HR Wet-DryVacuums,27.11,What are the different uses for this multi-purpose LED night light?,"This multi-purpose LED night light has various uses, such as providing a soft ambient light for your bedroom or acting as a motion sensor for added security.

Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, don't cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work (exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive). But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool (but you cant use just one single color). It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb.

Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, don't cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work (exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive). But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool (but you cant use just one single color). It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb.

Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup: It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1-star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app (Mi Home). It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day(!) of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn't have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you'd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it'd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. What's more!

I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn't have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you'd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it'd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone.

The best features once you pair your 3 different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth, switching connectivity is super fast - like you won't feel any lag in connectivity. The instructions strap helps to well understand this product. I bought at 2.6k, but I know it's price had dropped to 1.7K during Diwali Sale.Things I hate about this product -- I felt it would be light-weight but it isn't.- Buttons are rounded (but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great)- For gaming, buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which don't matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys (it's always WASD), but yes will be problematic if you play FIFA where there is extreme usage of arrow keys.So, 4/5 for overall experience.,Good portable keyboard. I can list out the pros and cons.Pros -1. Good Connectivity with Macbook pro latest OS2. Macbook keys are mapped properly as expected.3. Portable4. Simultaneous connectivity with 3 devicesCons-1. Not an ergonomic keyboard. Its flat and doesn't have any option to incline up.2. Dont have backlight keys. You can not see the keys in dark room.3. Keys are slightly hard to press, I think due to rubber dome.4. Enter key, I feel, is smaller which cant be sensed without seeing the keyboard.Overall, my purpose got fulfilled as i am able to use it with my Macbook pro after struggling with logitech R270 combo.,The keyboard is really good and it has a good built quality and the only con is that there is no indication of whether the caps lock is on or off.,Pros: easy to use, keys feels like mechanical keyboard. Can connect 3 devices. Supports Mac and windows. Place holder for mobile devices ( However, I use it to place a pen)Cons: Expensive. Very heavy ( feels like Macbook air). There is lag in connection whenever you turn on your laptop.,price is litter high,What an excellent product I got my hands on. Smooth working and connect to 3 different gadgets at the same time and u can work on any of them. Buttons are of good size so typing is easy and fast. The inbuilt holder for gadgets is really solid and helping. And it's connect to IPhone also.,Only uses for typing if horizontal view is suitable to see what we typingThink twice before buying,Not working properly on macbook pro! Switches to junk characters frequently which is really frustrating!How did I fix ?The keyboard switches to symbol/junk characters when the option key is pressed. So, I had to disable the option key in the keyboard and live with it!Apart from that above problem, It's a good looking keyboard. The keys are smooth to handle. Due to its container for tablet/phones, the product is not as compact as you might be expecting.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41hzQslWQlL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Black/dp/B00MUTWLW4/ref=sr_1_259?qid=1672903007&s=computers&sr=1-259,Keyboards,HR,High,B00MUTWLW4 High HR Keyboards,61.45,How many power options are available for this multi-purpose LED light?,There are 3 power options available for this multi-purpose LED light.,"The Logitech K480 keyboard is a versatile wireless keyboard that can connect to multiple devices and has a familiar layout for easy use.
